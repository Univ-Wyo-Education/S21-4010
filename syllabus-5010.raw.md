The zero-knowledge (zk-SNARK) is a user level for understanding - the math is deep and I don't know of a good paper to read that will
give a understanding of the math in it.

Consider z-Cash and Ripple.  Ripple is using a Honey Badger based consensus system.  z-Cash is using zero-knowledge proofs.
Both of these are 3rd generation systems.

Write up a 1 to 2 page informal proposal paper on how you would make BlockChain faster and more secure.  Would you combine these?
