# Lecture 14 - What is distributed consensus

All the different blockchain systems are really about Distributed Consensus.

The method for getting it different depending on how you go about it.  The biggest
distributed consensus system is Googles Spanner database based on F1 and BigTable.

Let's talk a little bit about F1.

First wold scale database.

Uses Atomic Clocks for Consistency.  With blockchian we get a slower system -
F1 is millisecond consistency - but it is decentralized.

Benefits to decentralized is that there is nobody "controlling" the system.
With the US dollar there is the FED that manipulates the supply and the 
value of the dollar.   There are many bad examples of a central bank
manipulating a currency - in the 1970's Argentina.  More recently
in Venezuela.

The US FED has done a good job.

You can see a similar kind of a graph when looking at commodity prices.
Since the 1930 most commodity prices have been much more stable.
The value of the dollar has been reasonably stable.

So... Not having a "FED" in a cryptocurrency means that there is nobody
controlling the available supply and the price is left to the market
to determine.

Back to consensus...

What is distributed consensus.
