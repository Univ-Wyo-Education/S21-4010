Transactions, Blocks and how they work together is important enough to deserve a clear walk through.
This is a different approach than I have done in an in-person class.  However I have circulated the
videos to a number of former students of in the class and they tell me that it is a really good
way to understand how these things come together.

Outline is really short.

1. An overview of what the blocks do - with example numbers. (Part 1 of video)
2. A step-by-step of how to get Assignment 03 to work. (parts 2..5)

This is a long set of videos.  If Assignment 03 is obvious to you then you won't need parts 2..5.
