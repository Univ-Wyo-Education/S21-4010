What does a Venetian friar have to do with your accounting system? It turns out, a lot.

Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar in Medieval Venice, wrote the Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalità in 1494. In it, he detailed a system of financial recordkeeping in which every debit (Latin for “he owes”) was matched to a credit (“he trusts”). He warned that a person should not go to sleep at night until his debits matched his credits. In his system, Pacioli included asset, liability, capital, income, and expense accounts: exactly those categories you would find on your own balance sheet and income statement. Although he is not credited with having invented the system (that designation goes to the Venetian merchants who used it), he is nonetheless known as the “Father of Accounting” for having put it to paper.

Although modern accounting revolves around double-entry bookkeeping, accounting as a technical craft existed long before Pacioli. Financial records of goods sold and money exchanged stretch back to ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria, Babylon, and Sumeria, where it likely functioned as an expedient to taxation and the operation of temples. There is even record of a state official in Egypt holding the title of “comptroller.”

	The Italian Luca Pacioli, recognized as The Father of accounting and bookkeeping was the first person to publish a work on double-entry bookkeeping, and introduced the field in Italy.



Al-Khwarizmı's book introduced al-jabr meaning "restoration” (which European translated as "algebra") to its inheritance accounting,  leading  to  three fundamental accounting - algebreic concepts:

	- Debits = Credits: algebraic manipulations on the left-hand and right-hand size of an equal sign had to "balance" or they were in error. This is the algebraic equivalent of double-entries "bookkeeping equation" for error control.
	- Real accounts: These included assets for tracking wealth, weighed against liabilities from the claims of others against that wealth, and the difference which is the owner's net wealth, or owner's equity.  This was al-Khwarizmi's "basic accounting equation".
	- Nominal accounts: These tracked activity that affected wealth, and the "restoration" into the real accounts reflected accounting's closing process and the calculation of the owner's increment in wealth -- net income.
Algebra balances and restores formulas on the left and right of an equal sign.   Double-entry bookkeeping similarly balances and restores debit and credit totals around an equal sign.  Accounting is the balancing and restoration of algebra applied to wealth accounting.[20]

Al-Khwarizmı's book, 720, introduced al-jabr meaning "restoration” is at the *root* of accounting. His work lead to three fundamental accounting principals:

- Debits = Credits: algebraic manipulations on the left-hand and right-hand size of an equal sign had to "balance" or they were in error. This is the algebraic equivalent of double-entries "bookkeeping equation" for error control.
- Real accounts: These included assets for tracking wealth, weighed against liabilities from the claims of others against that wealth, and the difference which is the owner's net wealth, or owner's equity.  This was al-Khwarizmi's "basic accounting equation".
- Nominal accounts: These tracked activity that affected wealth, and the "restoration" into the real accounts reflected accounting's closing process and the calculation of the owner's increment in wealth -- net income.

Later in 1500's Venice this would be converted into the basic concept of Debits and Credits in accounting.

Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar in Medieval Venice, wrote the "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità" in 1494.  Paciolini detailed a system of financial record keeping in which every debit (Latin for “he owes”) was matched to a credit (“he trusts”).   I think that the biggest confusion is
due to the terms.  Let's just think of Debit as the "D" column and credit as the "C" column.  In double entry bookkeeping the total of the D's must eual
the total of the C's.    A big part of the reason for doing it this way was that negative numbers had not been accepted.  So it all works on positives.

Al-Khwarizmı's concept of 0 players a critical role in this.   There is substantial historical evidence that acceptance of 0 as a valid result
is really the start of this revolution in accounting.

Pacioli's warning is that that a person should not go to sleep at night before the debits matched his credits.   He did not invent this system.
it was in use by a number of merchant families in Venice by the time he formalized it and wrote it down.

In this system there are asset, liability, capital, income, and expense accounts.  This is the basis of double-entry accounting - over 500 years ago.
The "magic" in this system is it becomes much more difficult to "cheat" and much easier to value the assets that a person or business has.  Like any
"model" it is not the "real" world.   In some ways it is Micky Mouse.

The European translation of al-jabar is Algebra.   The Process of applying a complex set of steps in al-jabar (Algebra) is referred to today as an
algorithm.
