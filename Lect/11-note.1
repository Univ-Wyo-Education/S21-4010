What does a Venetian friar have to do with your accounting system? It turns out, a lot.

Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar in Medieval Venice, wrote the Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalità in 1494. In it, he detailed a system of financial recordkeeping in which every debit (Latin for “he owes”) was matched to a credit (“he trusts”). He warned that a person should not go to sleep at night until his debits matched his credits. In his system, Pacioli included asset, liability, capital, income, and expense accounts: exactly those categories you would find on your own balance sheet and income statement. Although he is not credited with having invented the system (that designation goes to the Venetian merchants who used it), he is nonetheless known as the “Father of Accounting” for having put it to paper.

Although modern accounting revolves around double-entry bookkeeping, accounting as a technical craft existed long before Pacioli. Financial records of goods sold and money exchanged stretch back to ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria, Babylon, and Sumeria, where it likely functioned as an expedient to taxation and the operation of temples. There is even record of a state official in Egypt holding the title of “comptroller.”
