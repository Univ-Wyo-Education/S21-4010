## In the year 720

You don't often get Compute Science Lectures that start in the year 720!

Al-Khwarizmı's book, 720, introduced al-jabr meaning "restoration”
is at the *root* of accounting. His work lead to three fundamental
accounting principals:

- Debits = Credits: algebraic manipulations on the left-hand and
right-hand size of an equal sign had to "balance" or they were in
error. This is the algebraic equivalent of double-entries "bookkeeping
equation" for error control.

- Real accounts: These included assets for tracking wealth, weighed
against liabilities from the claims of others against that wealth,
and the difference which is the owner's net wealth, or owner's equity.
This was al-Khwarizmi's "basic accounting equation".

- Nominal accounts: These tracked activity that affected wealth, and the
"restoration" into the real accounts reflected accounting's closing
process and the calculation of the owner's increment in wealth --
net income.

Later in 1500's Venice this would be converted into the basic concept
of Debits and Credits in accounting.

Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar in Medieval Venice, wrote the "Summa
de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità" in 1494.
Paciolini detailed a system of financial record keeping in which every
debit (Latin for “he owes”) was matched to a credit (“he trusts”).
I think that the biggest confusion is due to the terms.  Let's just
think of Debit as the "D" column and credit as the "C" column.  In double
entry bookkeeping the total of the D's must eual the total of the C's.
A big part of the reason for doing it this way was that negative numbers
had not been accepted.  So it all works on positives.

Al-Khwarizmı's concept of 0 players a critical role in this.   There is
substantial historical evidence that acceptance of 0 as a valid result
is really the start of this revolution in accounting.

Pacioli's warning is that that a person should not go to sleep at night
before the debits matched his credits.   He did not invent this system.
it was in use by a number of merchant families in Venice by the time he
formalized it and wrote it down.

In this system there are asset, liability, capital, income, and
expense accounts.  This is the basis of double-entry accounting -
over 500 years ago.  The "magic" in this system is it becomes much
more difficult to "cheat" and much easier to value the assets that a
person or business has.  Like any "model" it is not the "real" world.
In some ways it is Micky Mouse.

The European translation of al-jabar is Algebra.   The Process of
applying a complex set of steps in al-jabar (Algebra) is referred to
today as an algorithm.

Some credit Generally Applied Accounting Principals, GAAP with the rise
of American business after WWII.  The purpose of GAAP is to create a
uniform standard for financial reporting.  When financial information
is made available to investors, it should serve the purpose of helping
these people make accurate and informed decisions as to where to put
their money.  This makes for more efficient financial markets. Similarly,
it should enable lenders to properly assess the financial condition of
companies and allow for accurate rates of risk in lending.

Blockchain is the first real "technological" advancement in accounting
in 500 years.
