# Lecture 05 - How wealth is created (Blockchain, AI/Classification)

Most of you came to university to create a career - basically to make money.
So let's talk about money!

Let's talk about averages for UW graduates.

Average for staring with a bachelors in Computer Science is $79,900.00,
UW is a little above averse, $82,000.00.

Average student loans, US average is $41,000.00.  UW is much better at
$22,800.00.

So...  You start out ahead for the very beginning!  That's always good.

Now if you follow the "banks" financing plan for student loans you
will pay off the loan in about 25 years and pay roughly 3x the value
of the loan - so you will pay about 46,000 in interest - total is 
a $68k .   Back before the pandemic I used to go to the bank - we won't
say which one I use but both of the banks that I use have a basket
with loly-pops on the counter.  They fill it up for the customers
with "Dum-Dum"s - I have always wanted to ask if that is a comment
on the customers!

So ... Let's talk about Rich.   

Rich graduated from UW with a Masters in Computer Science at the
same time as I did.    So... Roughly spiking we started at the
same point.  He worked for 32 years for the same company and
just this year took "retirement" from the copay.

His career path is a perfect example of saying "between the lines".

Here is how a "job" works.

You get hired.  For about 5 to 7 years you get raises.
After that you get cost of living - that is because a job is
really only worth what is worth.  SO after about 5 to 7 years
you get payed what the job is worth - not what you are worth.

You can move to a better job that pays more.  After 15 years
Rich got a MBA and moved into a management position and
raised how much he made.

So on average a UW Computer Science will start at  $82k and
over about 6 years that will grow to $102,200 - right at the
national average.

So ... 102k is good!  This is not a job at McDonalds.  I worked
at McDonalds.  I have tremendous respect for McDonalds.

Now if you do what Rich did - You get a good car, get married,
have some kids, a good house in the burbs.  You finance the
car for you and one for your wife, ... But at the end you
basically spend all you make.  Rich married a RN - that is
like a masters in nursing.  2 good paying jobs.

Don't get things wrong - I have worked and I think getting a good
education is important and a good job is a wonderful thing.

I think that a job - if you use it wrong really stands for
Journey Of the Broke.   At the end of 32 years of work
Rich had saved approx. $400,000.00 for retirement.
Between the two of them they were making over $200k a year.

His employer has a defined benefits retirement plan.  Hers
had a 401k.  So... They  are over 62 - old engorge to get
Social Security.

They have make somewhere north of 4 million - and at the end
all they have to show for it is - a payed off house, $625k,
$400k savings and social security and a retirement check
of $1420 a month.

SO... not broke but not really wealthy - notice that 
house + retirement makes Rich and wife millionaires!  But if
you pull out all of your wealth from a house - you sell it -
you now need a new house - most people want someplace to live.
Millionaire and living on the street as a bum is not most people's 
plan in life.

If you have no "financial plan" you are likely to end up where you plan to end up.
Nowhere.

The averages are grim.  95% of people in the US spend all that they make.
41% - according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics could not cover a
$400 emergency.   So if the fridge fails and they need a new one
they are going to finance it - probably on a credit card at 18% 
interest.   The average US amount of savings at age 65 is $200.
So if you are thinking that you are a poor student - if you have 
more than $200 you are ahead of the average 65 year old after
decades of work.    This is the "result" of not having a plan.

Now you don't have to have a plan right now - just finish your
degree - it is very valuable and you can get a good job with it.

My goal when I came to co ledge was to catch a girl!  I spent
10 years getting a BS and a MS and - a wonderful wife - we are
still madly in love - after 32 years of marriage.

So not all goals are for money.  There is lot's of other things in
life - and important tings to have goals for.  But...  On an average
day some money and a plan for financial stability is usually a good
way to create long term happiness.   I am gorging to say it.

# Sufficient Money Creates Happiness

A gob of money will not change your happiness - but enough money so that
you are not just scraping buy from month to month will make you
much happier.    A new car will get you happiness for a week or two.
After that it is just a question of safety, reliability and transpiration.
That is the way most *things* work.

If you go out and get a job, get a new car financed over 6 years (don't worry it will be worn out in 6 years and you will get a new one)
and then go looking for a house.  You save for a year or two - down payment, a house in a good neighborhood.   Paying for it for
30 years - on a mortgage.   These are all good things - but the reality is that this is now how wealth is created.   This is what
most people - with good degrees are doing.  Remember the 95% dead or broke at 65.  The first time I heard that statistic
my "bullshit" meter read lined.  No way - riches country in the world - can't be true.  So... Don't believe me.
Go out and do the research for yourself.

Now you need "enough" money - basically if you have enough so that you don't really need your job - you will find that
you are at a much lower stress level and a much happier place.  This is financial independence.   Think about a few scenarios.

You employer fails - and you have enough to live on - so you are not desperate - you relax and go find a new job in the
next 3 or 6 months and you go on.

The project you are on ends and you get payed off...  No big deal.

Both of these things have ha pend to me...  How about this one...  Your boss wants you do to X - in my travel to 
a new location for months - and you don't want to do X.  Supposedly this is voluntary.  Reality is that your
boss says to you, "If you don't do X ... You wont' be able to pay your mortgage."  Basically he tells you that
if you don't do it - you will get terminated.   To which I told my manager, "Unlike you I don't have a mortgage.
I payed for my house on the one-payment plan and you can't use that to manipulate me."  Three hours later I had
a different job.

# How is wealth created

First... Not all wealth is financial.  Mozart created wealth when he wrote music.  The world was a better place.
That is not money.

This points at our second financial myth.  That is that the world is a zero sum game.  That is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
It is not a zero sum game.   When you create a new thing that is useful, beneficial - then the world is a better place.  It is not zero sum.
You can "create" wealth.

Some "wealth" is just of benefit to lots of people - without creating money.  For example.  Let's say that you create a system
that eliminates malaria.  600,000 people a year die from malaria.   15,000,000 are critically ill a year from this disease.
Malaria has killed more people than all the wars, all the famines, all the diseases in all of human history.
Let's say you give it away.   Most places with this horrible disease are not wealthy - so you just give it away.  The world is
a better place but you have not made money.

There are 2 factors that create wealth.

They are time and leverage.  Generally speaking things that create wealth also involve some risk.
There is not much risk in what Rich did.  You are averaging your income with a bunch of other people
in a large business.  This eliminates most of the risk.  You can decide to go for a business and
plan on moving up the ranks into a senior management position.  That will pay lots more than just
being a developer.  You will now be making decisions that involve risk - for the business - and you will get payed more.
A lot more!  If you want to do that we have a person sitting in on this class, Dr Corey Billington, professor
in business that was a Senior VP at Hewlett Packard - and he has a plan, "Claims to Fame" that he teaches
in his business classes.  It will work and get you there.  Go take his classes in business - you can
use that information as your leverage and become wealthy.

You can invest in the stock market.  Smart investors in the stock market will make good money.  It has some risk,
but on average you can make a decent return.  I have and I continue to do this.  Leverage in this case
is using money that you didn't spend and having that money make money over time.   I think you shooed
get good at this and do it.

You can own rental property.  In this case you will take some of your money and probably some money
from a bank, the leverage, and combine it into a long term plan to turn that leverage into wealth.
I have done this in the past - and helped others to do this. It works.  Again --- you have to be
relatively smart about how you go about doing it.   You want to get decently priced property - that has
a good track record of rental.   Don't get yourself pulled into the zero-down stuff.   Plan on putting
about 1/2 down - so that if you have a rental that is empty - it won't cause you anguish.  Think ahead
at this being a business.   The purpose of a business is to make money.  Over time your "commercial real estate business"
has to make money.  There are tremendous tax advantages.   We are going to walk a scenario along these lines.

In computer science you also have some other alternatives.
In these cases the leverage is the "technology" itself.  Blockchain is one of these.  Artificial Intelligence - classification of
data is the other.  Forecasts for Blockchain are that it will be roughly 3% of the world economy in 15 to 20 years.  That is
*huge*.    Forecasts for AI are that it will replace between 25% and 45% of *ALL* - of *ALL* jobs in the world.

This is *way way* more opportunity - right now - than all the IT / Computer  / Web stuff in the past 30 years.

The Bureau Of Labor Spastics spent 		$5.6 million studying the AI - and figuring out what businesses are most likely to 
be automated - so if you want a list of hundreds of billion dollar business - then they did the research for you.
The research is on what jobs are least likely to be automated.  Just look at the bottom of the list - flip it upside
down and say - what is most like to be automated.   Go and build one of these.  Get good at it!

I wanted to build a product company.   After some analysis and research I determined that a product that automated what Database Administrators DBAs do - would be a good product.
I had never worked as a "DBA".  So I purchased every book on the subject, 43 of them at the time, and I read all of them.   I got a job as a DBA.  I learned the thing that I 
wanted to do a product in.  Raised VC, built a company and sold it in 5 years.

So if you don't know about X - then good.  Learn it.  Get good at it.  Automate it.  Figure out how to monetize the automation and you will make money.
