<p>Most of you came to university to create a career - basically to make money.
So let&rsquo;s talk about money!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about averages for UW graduates.</p>

<p>Average salary for starting with a bachelors in Computer Science is $79,900.00,
UW is a little above average, $82,000.00.</p>

<p>Average US student loans are $41,000.00.  UW is much better at
$22,800.00.</p>

<p>So&hellip;  You start out ahead from the very beginning!  That&rsquo;s always good.</p>

<p>Now, if you follow the &ldquo;banks&rdquo; financing plan for student loans, you
will pay off the loan in about 25 years and pay roughly 3x the value
of the loan - so you will pay about $46,000 in interest - the total is
a $68k .   Back before the pandemic I used to go to the bank - I  won&rsquo;t
say which one I use -  but both of the banks that I use have a basket
with lollipops on the counter.  They fill it up for the customers
with &ldquo;Dum-Dums&rdquo; - I have always wanted to ask if that is a comment
on the customers!</p>

<p>So &hellip; Let&rsquo;s talk about Rich.</p>

<p>Rich graduated from UW with a Masters in Computer Science at the
same time as I did.    So&hellip; Roughly speaking we started at the
same point.  He worked for 32 years for the same company and
just this year took &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; from the company.</p>

<p>His career path is a perfect example of staying &ldquo;between the lines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is how a &ldquo;job&rdquo; works.</p>

<p>You get hired.  For about 5 to 7 years you get raises.
After that you get cost of living - that is because a job is
really only worth what is worth.  SO after about 5 to 7 years
you get payed what the job is worth - not what you are worth.</p>

<p>You can move to a better job that pays more.  After 15 years
Rich got a MBA and moved into a management position and
raised how much he made.</p>

<p>So on average a UW Computer Science student will start at  $82k and
over about 6 years that will grow to $102,200 - right at the
national average.</p>

<p>So &hellip; 102k is good!  This is not a job at McDonald&rsquo;s.  I worked
at McDonalds.  I have tremendous respect for McDonalds.</p>

<p>Now if you do what Rich did - You get a good car, get married,
have some kids, and have a good house in the burbs.  You finance the
car for you and one for your wife, &hellip; But at the end you
basically spend all you make.  Rich married a RN - that is
like a masters in nursing.  2 good paying jobs.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get things wrong - I have worked and I think getting a good
education is important and a good job is a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>I think that a job - if you use it wrong really stands for
Journey Of the Broke.   At the end of 32 years of work
Rich had saved approx. $400,000.00 for retirement.
Between the two of them they were making over $200k a year.</p>

<p>His employer has a defined benefits retirement plan.  Hers
had a 401k.  So&hellip; They  are over 62 - old enough to get
Social Security.</p>

<p>They have made somewhere north of 4 million - and at the end
all they have to show for it is - a payed off house, $625k,
$400k savings and social security and a retirement check
of $1420 a month.</p>

<p>SO&hellip; not broke but not really wealthy - notice that
house + retirement makes Rich and wife millionaires!  But if
you pull out all of your wealth from a house - you sell it -
you now need a new house - most people want someplace to live.
Millionaire and living on the street as a bum is not most people&rsquo;s
plan in life.</p>

<p>If you have no &ldquo;financial plan&rdquo;, you are likely to end up where you plan to end up.
Nowhere.</p>

<p>The averages are grim.  95% of people in the US spend all that they make.
41% - according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics could not cover a
$400 emergency.   So if the fridge fails and they need a new one
they are going to finance it - probably on a credit card at 18%
interest.   The average US amount of savings at age 65 is $200.
So if you are thinking that you are a poor student - if you have
more than $200 you are ahead of the average 65 year old after
decades of work.    This is the &ldquo;result&rdquo; of not having a plan.</p>

<p>Now you don&rsquo;t have to have a plan right now - just finish your
degree - it is very valuable and you can get a good job with it.</p>

<p>My goal when I came to colledge was to catch a girl!  I spent
10 years getting a BS and a MS and - a wonderful wife - we are
still madly in love - after 32 years of marriage.</p>

<p>So not all goals are for money.  There is lot&rsquo;s of other things in
life - and important things to have goals for.  But&hellip;  On an average
day some money and a plan for financial stability is usually a good
way to create long term happiness.   I am going to say it.</p>

<h1>Sufficient Money Creates Happiness</h1>

<p>A gob of money will not change your happiness - but enough money so that
you are not just scraping buy from month to month will make you
much happier.    A new car will get you happiness for a week or two.
After that it is just a question of safety, reliability and transpiration.
That is the way most <em>things</em> work.</p>

<p>If you go out and get a job, get a new car financed over 6 years, (don&rsquo;t worry it will be worn out in 6 years and you will get a new one),
and then go looking for a house.  You save for a year or two - down payment, a house in a good neighborhood.   Paying for it for
30 years - on a mortgage.   These are all good things - but the reality is that this is now how wealth is created.   This is what
most people  with good degrees are doing.  Remember the 95% dead or broke at 65.  The first time I heard that statistic
my &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; meter red lined.  No way - richest country in the world - can&rsquo;t be true.  So&hellip; Don&rsquo;t believe me.
Go out and do the research for yourself.</p>

<p>Now you need &ldquo;enough&rdquo; money - basically if you have enough so that you don&rsquo;t really need your job - you will find that
you are at a much lower stress level and a much happier place.  This is financial independence.   Think about a few scenarios.</p>

<p>You employer fails - and you have enough to live on - so you are not desperate - you relax and go find a new job in the
next 3 or 6 months and you go on.</p>

<p>The project you are on ends and you get payed off&hellip;  No big deal.</p>

<p>Both of these things have happend to me&hellip;  How about this one&hellip;  Your boss wants you to do X - in my case travel to
a new location for months - and you don&rsquo;t want to do X.  Supposedly this is voluntary.  Reality is that your
boss says to you, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t do X &hellip; You wont&rsquo; be able to pay your mortgage.&rdquo;  Basically he tells you that
if you don&rsquo;t do it - you will get terminated.   To which I told my manager, &ldquo;Unlike you I don&rsquo;t have a mortgage.
I payed for my house on the one-payment plan and you can&rsquo;t use that to manipulate me.&rdquo;  Three hours later I had
a different job.</p>

<h1>How is wealth created</h1>

<p>First&hellip; Not all wealth is financial.  Beethoven  created wealth when he wrote music.  The world was a better place.
That is not money.</p>

<p>This points at our second financial myth which is that the world is a zero sum game.  That is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
It is not a zero sum game.   When you create a new thing that is useful, beneficial - then the world is a better place.  It is not zero sum.
You can &ldquo;create&rdquo; wealth.</p>

<p>Some &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; is just of benefit to lots of people - without creating money.  For example.  Let&rsquo;s say that you create a system
that eliminates malaria.  600,000 people a year die from malaria.   15,000,000 are critically ill a year from this disease.
Malaria has killed more people than all the wars, all the famines, all the diseases in all of human history.
Let&rsquo;s say you give it away.   Most places with this horrible disease are not wealthy - so you just give it away.  The world is
a better place but you have not made money.</p>

<p>There are 2 factors that create wealth.</p>

<p>They are time and leverage.  Generally speaking things that create wealth also involve some risk.
There is not much risk in what Rich did.  You are averaging your income with a bunch of other people
in a large business.  This eliminates most of the risk.  You can decide to go for a business and
plan on moving up the ranks into a senior management position.  That will pay lots more than just
being a developer.  You will now be making decisions that involve risk - for the business - and you will get payed more.
A lot more!  If you want to do that we have a person sitting in on this class, Dr Corey Billington a professor
in business, that was a Senior VP at Hewlett Packard - and he has a plan, &ldquo;Claims to Fame&rdquo; that he teaches
in his business classes.  It will work and get you there.  Go take his classes in business - you can
use that information as your leverage and become wealthy.</p>

<p>You can invest in the stock market.  Smart investors in the stock market will make good money.  It has some risk,
but on average you can make a decent return.  I have and I continue to do this.  Leverage in this case
is using money that you didn&rsquo;t spend and having that money make money over time.   I think you should
get good at this and do it.</p>

<p>You can own rental property.  In this case you will take some of your money and probably some money
from a bank, the leverage, and combine it into a long term plan to turn that leverage into wealth.
I have done this in the past - and helped others to do this. It works.  Again --- you have to be
relatively smart about how you go about doing it.   You want to get decently priced property - that has
a good track record of rental.   Don&rsquo;t get yourself pulled into the zero-down stuff.   Plan on putting
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> down - so that if you have a rental that is empty - it won&rsquo;t cause you anguish.  Think ahead
at this being a business.   The purpose of a business is to make money.  Over time your &ldquo;commercial real estate business&rdquo;
has to make money.  There are tremendous tax advantages.   We are going to walk a scenario along these lines.</p>

<p>In computer science you also have some other alternatives.
In these cases the leverage is the &ldquo;technology&rdquo; itself.  Blockchain is one of these.  Artificial Intelligence - classification of
data is the other.  Forecasts for Blockchain are that it will be roughly 3% of the world economy in 15 to 20 years.  That is
<em>huge</em>.    Forecasts for AI are that it will replace between 25% and 45% of <em>ALL</em> - of <em>ALL</em> jobs in the world.</p>

<p>This is <em>way way</em> more opportunity - right now - than all the IT / Computer  / Web stuff in the past 30 years.</p>

<p>The Bureau Of Labor Stastics spent  $5.6 million studying AI -  figuring out what businesses are most likely to
be automated - so if you want a list of hundreds of billion dollar business - then they did the research for you.
The research is on what jobs are least likely to be automated.  Just look at the bottom of the list - flip it upside
down and say - what is most likely to be automated.   Go and build one of these.  Get good at it!</p>

<p>I wanted to build a product company.   After some analysis and research I determined that a product that automated what Database Administrators, DBAs, do - would be a good product.
I had never worked as a &ldquo;DBA&rdquo;.  So I purchased every book on the subject, 43 of them at the time, and I read all of them.   I got a job as a DBA.  I learned the thing that I
wanted to do a product in.  I raised VC, built a company and sold it in 5 years.</p>

<p>So if you don&rsquo;t know about X - then good.  Learn it.  Get good at it.  Automate it.  Figure out how to monetize the automation and you will make money.</p>
