## Instructor contact information:

Email: pschlump@uwyo.edu

Phone: (for emergencies) 720-209-7888 - before you call you need to SMS me with who you are and what class you are in so that I add
you to my address book.  I get far too many robo-calls to answer unknown phone numbers.  Generally I am available from 7AM to 10PM.

## Office hours:

I will hold office hours from 8:00AM to 9:00AM on Monday, Wednesday and Friday or by appointment.
Office hours are on zoom - I will send out a link via email.

## Required texts

Textbook: We have a textbook for the 2nd 1/2 of the class on  Ethereum/Solidity. Solidity has moved from version 5.12 to 5.17 in the past 3 months.
The text book for Go is a free online PDF: [https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
We will also be using IOHK’s BlockChian. It is programmed in Haskell.

This means that you will need to program in Go, Solidity, Haskell in a single semester.  We will have some focus on how to learn a new
language and become effective in that language.

## General requirements and expectations for the course

You must demonstrate working homework to the instructor or to the class grader to pass the class (no matter how many
points you get). For code developed in Go, test cases will be supplied.  The Go homework are cumulative.
Assignment 3 depends on getting a working version of 2 etc.

The class will have lectures - pre-record, discussion groups that have attendance taken - you are required to attend
the discussion - they will be at 3 different times of the day.   The topic is the same at each
time so just attend one time.  There are 5 of these.



## Required examinations and assignments

There will be 9 programming assignments over the course of the semester, as well as one midterm and a final exam. Tests
will be 800 points. 400 for the midterm, 400 for the final. 1,400 points are from the homework and paper, 100 to 200
points per assignment.

## Final / Midterm Examination

Midterm will be a short answer and multiple choice online from a test bank.

Final will be online - probably a writing assignment.

## Grading Scale:

| Letter Grade | Points                                    |
|:------------:|-------------------------------------------|
| A            | 1,800 points or above                     |
| B            | 1,600-1,799 points                        |
| C            | 1,400-1,599 points                        |
| D            | 1,200-1,399 points                        |

## Extra credit

None planned at this time.

## Late work.

Work turned in late will loose 10% per calendar day, down to 40% of the original grade.  Nothing may be turned in after the last day of class.

## Class Overview

1.  What is Blockchain / Bitcoin and Why it is Important.
In 2009 a person or group of people named Satoshi Nakamoto published ["Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) .  The Bitcoin design was revolutionary — it elegantly tied cryptography, game theory, and economics
into a trust-less solution to the double-spend problem, and introduced the world to the first “chain of blocks,” a
censorship-resistant public ledger protected by proof-of-work.
This is a big deal. Unlike traditional payments, Bitcoin transactions don’t rely on a trusted third-party. Anyone can
connect to the network and transact, without fear of censorship. Satoshi’s work solved these problems, and founded the
field of cryptoeconomics.
In 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed a new cryptocurrency — Ethereum. Ethereum was Vitalik’s answer to Bitcoin’s
poor scripting capabilities. Instead of focusing on financial transactions and their outputs, Ethereum transactions are
about state: agreeing on a computed state, and transitioning from one state to the next.
Each transaction in Ethereum includes a sender, recipient, funds, and data, similar enough to Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, however, a recipient can be a user or a smart contract.
2. Gartner group projects that 3% of the world economy will be BlockChain based in 10 years. This is a compounded annual
growth rate of 62.2%.
3. The Plan - Do lectures in advance of when assignments are due on the material and give students time to do homework.
Mark what is going to be tested on.
4. This class is not a “heavy” programming class. Yes, you will program but not a huge amount. Unlike a lot of
computer science classes this class has a paper and will have test questions involving definitions. We are going to
cover some finance, accounting, economics and other topics and not just “how to build a better program.” If you have
a limited programming background I will work with you.




# The 5 Interactive Discussions.

 These are required.  They will be
on zoom.  Choose a time of day to attend.  They will be held at 3 different
times a day - so you only need to attend one of the 3 on that a day.
Each of the synchronous zoom discussions will be at 9:00am, 4:00pm and
6:00pm on a Wednesday.  If you are unable to make one of the times let me
know and I will find a time.  These will be about 45 minutes long.

## Title IX – Duty to Report

The University of Wyoming faculty are committed to helping create a safe learning environment for all students and for
the university as a whole. If you have experienced any form of gender or sex-based discrimination or harassment,
including sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence, or stalking, know that help and support are
available. The University has staff members trained to support survivors in navigating campus life, accessing health and
counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, and more. The University strongly encourages all
students to report any such incidents to the University. Please be aware that all University of Wyoming employees,
including student staff, are required to report all Title IX related concerns to the Title IX Coordinator or their
supervisor. This means that if you tell a faculty member about a situation of sexual harassment or sexual violence, or
other related misconduct, the faculty member must share that information with the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
UW’s Title IX Coordinator is Jim Osborn (Manager of Investigations, Equal Opportunity Report and Response). He is
located in Room 320 of the Bureau of Mines Building, and can be reached via email at report-it@uwyo.edu or via phone at
766-5200 or 766-5228. For more information, go to:
[http://www.uwyo.edu/reportit/learn-more/faqs.html](http://www.uwyo.edu/reportit/learn-more/faqs.html) .

## Attendance and Absence policies

Attendance is critical. There is no text book for ALL of the material. The only way to know what you need to know is by
attending class. If you have an excused absence that is fine, try to get notes from the day you missed from one of your
classmates. Just don't skip!

## Classroom Behavior Policy

At all times, treat your presence in the classroom and your enrollment in this course as you would a job. Act
professionally, arrive on time, pay attention, complete your work in a timely and professional manner. You will be
respectful towards your classmates and instructor. Spirited debate and disagreement are to be expected in any classroom
and all views will be heard fully, but at all times we will behave civilly and with respect towards one another.
Personal attacks, offensive language, name-calling, and dismissive gestures are not warranted in a learning atmosphere.
As the instructor, I have the right to dismiss you from the classroom.

## Classroom Statement on Diversity

The University of Wyoming values an educational environment that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive. The diversity
that students and faculty bring to class, including age, country of origin, culture, disability, economic class,
ethnicity, gender identity, immigration status, linguistic, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation,
veteran status, worldview, and other social and cultural diversity is valued, respected, and considered a resource for
learning.

## Disability Support

If you have a physical, learning, sensory or psychological disability and require accommodations, please register as
soon as possible and provide documentation of your disability to Disability Support Services (DSS), Room 109 Knight
Hall. You may also contact DSS at (307) 766-3073 or udss@uwyo.edu. Visit their website for more
information: www.uwyo.edu/udss

## Academic Dishonesty Policies

Don't cheat on the exams. I expect you to take full advantage of all the online resources you can get your hands on.
That includes Stack Overflow, Github etc. If you do use someone else's code, put in a link to where you found it.
Don't cheat on the projects - do you own work.  Most of the learning in the class is from *doing* the projects.

## Substantive changes to syllabus

All deadlines, requirements, and course structure are subject to change if deemed necessary by the instructor. Students
will be notified verbally in class, on our WyoCourses page announcement, and via email of these changes. I do travel
during the semester. Class could be canceled or assignments due dates changed.
